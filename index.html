            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>I was born in Australia, attended Northcote High School where I completed VCE, and I am now in my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I am regrettably only monolingual in English, but I am looking to start studying Chinese again. I’m currently blessed with a brown mid-sized Labradoodle named Huckle, as well as pile of unpainted Warhammer miniatures that act as the skeleton in my closet. </p>

            <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>My interest in IT properly started at age 15 when a friend of mine built his own PC and then convinced me to do the same. After the research we did leading up to the buying of our parts, we worked together constructing and setting up my first computer. Since then, I've experimented with all kinds of things from booting Windows off of Macs, to formatting flash drive using command line. All this led me to the natural conclusion of choosing to study IT for my tertiary education. I then choose to study at RMIT for a few reasons: Firstly, it’s the institute of technology and, as such, has a good reputation for its computing courses. Secondly, it was the closest University to me with a very simple public transport route. And finally, its where my dad studied before me. </p>

            <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>My ideal job would be a to become a musician/artist. That being said there really isn’t an advertisement for this job, all employment; comes from scouting and subsequent recording contracts or deals to the best of my knowledge. Unfortunately recording contracts aren’t published in the public domain so I don’t have any historical examples to provide so I can only reference other musicians and they’re experiences.</p>
            <ul class="listindent">
              <li>To me being an artist comes down to a few key points, the biggest of which being playing and releasing music. However, there is something to keep note of: this job has been done by so many people over so many years that it has been done almost all ways imaginable. With this in mind, I’m now going to lay out what this means in relation to me and what I want to do. For me, being an artist means going through the process of writing, recording and releasing that music
              <li>Being an artist appeals to me because music is a massive part of my life and while it is amazing to listen to music, creating and performing music is not amazing but even better. That is the direction I dream of taking my life in; the chance to write, perform and release my own creations into the world
              <li>The skills needed for this career are as follows: proficiency with at least one musical instrument, with further proficiency and or mastery of the same or any other number of instruments being greatly beneficial. An ability to write music including the necessary understanding of music theory. The final requirement would be experience recording and performing
              <li>While I’ve played a few instruments since I was around nine years old, I am not currently practiced to level that I believe would be adequate for the role, I have not had practice recording and the last time I performed to any sort of audience was 2019. I consider this to be a lack of current experience and a lack of solo experience, although solo experience is not completely necessary. Additionally, I am not very practiced with song writing and feel that my music theory may be somewhat lacking

            <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h4>
            <p>According to the material supplied by 16personalities.com, adventurers tend to be fiercely independent individuals capable of imagining ‘out of the box’ solutions and bringing them to life. This, in addition with the other results, shows an ability to independently create and implement practical solutions whilst having an awareness for the team members and environment and how that effects the work.</p>
            <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h4>
            <p>While these results indicate I can contribute problem solving and creativity to a team. They also point to the fact that I can become easily stressed and may experience fluctuating self-esteem. As a result, when forming a team, it is advantageous for me to look for team members who cope well with stress.</p>

            <h3>Project Idea</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This project would consist of the construction of a synthesiser. The synthesiser would have an analogue interface with digital elements. This project would consist of either building a synthesiser from very basic components, or a more digital and code-centric solution.</p>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>The motivation for this project comes from an aforementioned interest in music and the desire to build gear. It would certainly be interesting as it encompasses many facets of Information Technology with both connecting hardware through digital and analogue means, as well as programming sounds and functionalities into the device. On top of this, it can be done many different ways. With cheaper Arduino and raspberry pi powered solutions being an easy way to implement this project being one of many ways of executing it; the concept has the flexibility to be more coding dependant than hardware, or to do the opposite.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>The synth will need a case fabricated, bare PCB is a bad look as well as dangerous in general for the PCB and the user. The ideal method of input would be for a keyboard style input common among synthesisers with a possibility of drum pads or switches for additional effects; this is what’s known as the controller of the synthesiser. There are additional effects that need to be implemented and modifiable in the final product. They include octave adjustments; envelopes, which controls the attack decay sustain and release of the synthesizer; attack which is the initial part of a note which then lowers down through the decay section; if the note is held it enters into sustain and once it is let go release happens. These components are really important. Another very important component to a synthesiser is a voltage-controlled oscillator, which is what produces the wave, making it the source of the sound for the synthesiser. You pair this with the envelope generator and voltage-controlled filters to help shape the sound. This is all fed into a voltage-controlled amplifier before reaching the onboard amplifier. In short, the oscillator makes the noise, the filter shapes it, the envelope changes how it interacts with the piano keys. The voltage-controlled amp acts as a preamp for the onboard amp. The term voltage control has been mentioned a couple of times and it simply means the sound is adjustable at any point that is voltage controlled which allows for great variability in sound. All the previously listed components allow us to produce the following features:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>A set of keys to control the synthesiser.
              <li>Different shaped sound waves from an oscillator.
              <li>Customisation of Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release.
              <li>Ability to move up and down octaves.
              <li>A case to house the synth.
              <li>Filters to change and shape the oscillators wave.
              <li>The amplifiers to make some noise.
            </ol>
            <p>All these components are the bare necessities for a simple synthesiser, but there are a few desirable features such as MIDI support, allowing for use as a MIDI controller with a Digital Audio Workstation. Loop functionality would also be a good feature alongside an arpeggiator function.</p>
            <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
            <p>Depending on the complexity of the approach there are roughly two different potential options. The first option is to use a raspberry pi, Arduino or another board-based technology and equip it with some inputs and outputs, this would mean a mostly digital synthesiser that would also be compact. On the other hand, there is the mostly analogue option, which involves more hardware centric design and involves assembling most of the parts. This appears to not be as feasible or as efficient as the board-based method of creation. The board-based approach would also allow for greater utilisation of the skills relevant to our degree.</p>
            <h4>Skills Required</h4>
            <p>For the more likely board-based solution, the team working on the project would need to research and select languages to write and develop the code in, this may be limited by the hardware used such as having to only use select languages with Arduino’s due to compatibility with the Arduino board. In addition, some fabrication and electronics knowledge will be necessary to manufacture housing and install inputs for the synthesiser.</p>
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>The ideal end product is a functioning and usable synthesiser with standard features built with inexpensive resources to a reasonably functional standard and relatively compact form factor, with a clear and repeatable process as well as a large amount of customisation around codable elements.</p>
