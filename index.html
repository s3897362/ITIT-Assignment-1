            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>I was born in Australia, attended Northcote Highschool where I completed VCE, and I am now in my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I am regrettably only a monolingual English, but I am looking to start studying Chinese again. I’m currently blessed with a brown mid-sized Labradoodle named Huckle, as well as pile of unpainted Warhammer minis that act as the skeleton in my closet.

            <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>My interest in IT properly started at age 15 when a friend of mine built his own PC and then convinced me to do the same, the research we did leading up to the buying of our parts. Since then, I've experimented with all kinds of things from booting windows off of macs to formatting flash drives from command line out of frustration. All this led me to the natural conclusion of choosing to study IT for my tertiary education and I then choose to do that at RMIT for a few reasons: Firstly, it’s the institute of technology and as such has a good reputation for its computing courses which IT is one of. Secondly it was the closest University to me with a very simple public transport route. And finally, its where my dad studied before me.

            <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>My ideal job would be a Musician. That being said there really isn’t an advertisement for this job, all employment comes from scouting and subsequent recording contracts or deals to the best of my knowledge. Unfortunately recording contracts aren’t published in the public domain so I don’t have any historical examples to provide so I can only reference other Musicians and they’re experiences.</p>
            <ul class="listindent">
              <li>To me being an Artist come down to a few key points, the biggest of which being playing and releasing music, however there is something to keep note of: This job has been done by so many people over so many years that it has been done almost all ways imaginable, and with this in mind I’m now going to lay out what this means in relation to me and what I want to do. For me being an Artist means going through the process of writing, recording and releasing that music
              <li>Being an Artist appeals to me because music is a massive part of my life and while it is amazing to listen to music, creating and perform music is not amazing but mythic. That is the direction I want to take my life in, the chance to write, perform and release my own creations into the world.
              <li>The skills needed for this are as follows: proficiency with at least one musical instrument, with further proficiency and or mastery of the same or any other number of instruments being greatly beneficial. An ability to write music including the necessary understanding of music theory. The final requirement would be experience recording and performing
              <li>While I’ve played a few instruments since I was around 9 years old, I am not currently practiced to level that I believe would be adequate for the role, I have not had practice recording and the last time I performed to any sort of audience was 2019, I consider this to be a lack of current experience and a lack of solo experience although, solo experience is not completely necessary. Additionally, I am not very practiced with song writing and feel that my music theory may be somewhat lacking

            <p></p>
            <p>My results from USCprice's leadership style quiz: "Postmodern Leader. You understand that leadership is both an art and a science. More than most, you recognize the joy available in the role of a leader. The pleasure of leadership is realized through the transformation of society and the realization of human potential. Leadership is an action that brings you greater self-awareness. Your keen awareness helps others see their own life in a new light. You help others realize the empowerment that comes from creating the future with others."</p>
            <h4>Strengths and Weaknesses</h4>
            <ul class="swblock">
              <li>Charming
              <li>Sensitive to others
              <li>Imaginative
              <li>Passionate
              <li>Curious
              <li>Artistic

              <li>Fluctuating Self-Esteem
            </ul>
            <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h4>
            <p>As seen 16personalities.com says that adventurers tend to be fiercely independent individuals capable of imagining out of the box solutions and bringing them to life. This in addition with the other results shows an ability independently create and implement practical solutions whilst housing an awareness for the team members and environment and how that effects the work</p>
            <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h4>
            <p>While these results point to a potential for great problem solving and creativity, they also point to the success of a team being dependant on the interactions of the team with emphasis on encouraging and empowering each other, shared passions and a clear vision to reduce stress load.</p>

            <h3>Project Idea</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This project would consist of the construction of a synthesiser. The synthesiser would have an analogue interface with digital elements. This project would consist of either building a synthesiser from very basic components or more digital and code centric pieces.</p>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>The motivation for this project comes from an aforementioned interest in music and the desire to build gear. It would certainly be interesting as it encompasses many facets of Information Technology with both connecting hardware through digital and analogue means as well as programming sounds and functionalities into the device and on top of this it can be done many different ways. With cheaper Arduino and raspberry pi powered solutions being an easy way to implement this project being one of many ways of executing it; the concept has the flexibility to be more coding dependant than hardware or to do the opposite.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>The synth will need a case fabricated, bare PCB is a bad look as well as dangerous in general for the PCB and the user. The ideal method of input would be for a keyboard style input common among synthesisers with a possibility of drum pads or switches for additional effects, this is what’s known as the controller of the synthesiser. There are additional effects that need to be implemented and modifiable in the final product such as octave, envelopes are what controls the attack decay sustain and release of the synthesizer, attack is the initial part of a note which then lowers down through the decay section, if the note is held it enters into sustain and once it is let go release happens, these components are really important. Another very important component to a synthesiser is a Voltage controlled oscillator which is what produces the wave making it essentially the source of the sound for the synthesiser pair this with the envelope generator and voltage-controlled filters to help shape the sound this is all fed into a voltage-controlled amplifier before reaching the onboard amplifier. In short, the Oscillator makes the noise, the filter shapes it, the envelope changes how it interacts with the piano keys, the voltage-controlled amp which acts as a preamp for the onboard amp. The term voltage control has been mentioned a couple of times and it simply means the sound is adjustable at any point that is voltage controlled which allows for great variability in sound. All the previously listed components allow us to produce the following features:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Different shaped sound waves from an oscillator.
              <li>Customisation of Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release.
              <li>A set of keys to control the synthesiser.
              <li>Ability to move up and down octaves.
              <li>A case to house the synth.
              <li>Filters to change and shape the oscillators wave.
              <li>The amplifiers to make some noise. 
            </ol>
            <p>All these components are the bare necessities to host said features but there are a few nice to have features such as MIDI support allowing for the use as a MIDI controller with a Digital Audio Workstation. Loop functionality would also be a good feature alongside an arpeggiator function.</p>
            <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
            <p>Depending on the complexity of the approach there are roughly two different streams. The first option is to use a raspberry pi, Arduino or another board-based technology similar to the two and equip it with some inputs and outputs, this would mean a mostly digital synthesiser that would also be compact. On the other hand, there is the mostly analog option of making a lot of the parts and functions mostly hardware based, this appears to not be a feasible nor as efficient as the previously mentioned board-based method of creation.</p>
            <h4>Skills Required</h4>
            <p>For the more likely digital based solution the team working on the project would need to research and select languages to write and develop the code in, this may be limited by the hardware used such as having to only use select languages with Arduino’s due to compatibility with the Arduino board, additionally some fabrication and electronics knowledge will be necessary to manufacture housing and install inputs for the synthesiser.</p>
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>The ideal end product is a functioning and usable synthesiser with standard features built with in expensive resources to a decently functional standard and relatively compact form factor, with a clear and repeatable process as well as a large amount of customisation around codable elements.</p>
