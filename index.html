            <p>I was born in Australia, attended Northcote Highschool where I completed VCE and I am now in my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I am regrettably only a monolingual English, but I am looking to start studying Chinese again. I’m currently blessed with a brown mid-sized Labradoodle named Huckle, as well as pile of unpainted Warhammer minis that act as the skeleton in my closet.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>My ideal job would be a Musician. That being said there really isn’t an advertisement for this job, all employment comes from scouting and subsequent recording contracts or deals to the best of my knowledge. Unfortunately recording contracts aren’t published in the public domain so I don’t have any historical examples to provide so I can only reference other Musicians and they’re experiences.</p>
            <ul class="listindent">
              <li>To me being an Artist come down to a few key points, the biggest of which being playing and releasing music, however there is something to keep note of: This job has been done by so many people over so many years that it has been done almost all ways imaginable, and with this in mind I’m now going to lay out what this means in relation to me and what I want to do. For me being an Artist means going through the process of writing, recording and releasing that music
              <li>Being an Artist appeals to me because music is a massive part of my life and while it is amazing to listen to music, creating and perform music is not amazing but mythic. That is the direction I want to take my life in, the chance to write, perform and release my own creations into the world.
