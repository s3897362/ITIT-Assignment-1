            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>I was born in Australia, attended Northcote Highschool where I completed VCE, and I am now in my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I am regrettably only a monolingual English, but I am looking to start studying Chinese again. I’m currently blessed with a brown mid-sized Labradoodle named Huckle, as well as pile of unpainted Warhammer minis that act as the skeleton in my closet.

            <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>My interest in IT properly started at age 15 when a friend of mine built his own PC and then convinced me to do the same, the research we did leading up to the buying of our parts. Since then, I've experimented with all kinds of things from booting windows off of macs to formatting flash drives from command line out of frustration. All this led me to the natural conclusion of choosing to study IT for my tertiary education and I then choose to do that at RMIT for a few reasons: Firstly, it’s the institute of technology and as such has a good reputation for its computing courses which IT is one of. Secondly it was the closest University to me with a very simple public transport route. And finally, its where my dad studied before me.

            <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subcontent">
            <p>My ideal job would be a Musician. That being said there really isn’t an advertisement for this job, all employment comes from scouting and subsequent recording contracts or deals to the best of my knowledge. Unfortunately recording contracts aren’t published in the public domain so I don’t have any historical examples to provide so I can only reference other Musicians and they’re experiences.</p>
            <ul class="listindent">
              <li>To me being an Artist come down to a few key points, the biggest of which being playing and releasing music, however there is something to keep note of: This job has been done by so many people over so many years that it has been done almost all ways imaginable, and with this in mind I’m now going to lay out what this means in relation to me and what I want to do. For me being an Artist means going through the process of writing, recording and releasing that music
              <li>Being an Artist appeals to me because music is a massive part of my life and while it is amazing to listen to music, creating and perform music is not amazing but mythic. That is the direction I want to take my life in, the chance to write, perform and release my own creations into the world.
              <li>The skills needed for this are as follows: proficiency with at least one musical instrument, with further proficiency and or mastery of the same or any other number of instruments being greatly beneficial. An ability to write music including the necessary understanding of music theory. The final requirement would be experience recording and performing
              <li>While I’ve played a few instruments since I was around 9 years old, I am not currently practiced to level that I believe would be adequate for the role, I have not had practice recording and the last time I performed to any sort of audience was 2019, I consider this to be a lack of current experience and a lack of solo experience although, solo experience is not completely necessary. Additionally, I am not very practiced with song writing and feel that my music theory may be somewhat lacking

            <p>My results from the Myers Briggs based test from 16Personalities.com:</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>My results from eduationplanner.org's learning styles quiz:</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>My results from USCprice's leadership style quiz: "Postmodern Leader. You understand that leadership is both an art and a science. More than most, you recognize the joy available in the role of a leader. The pleasure of leadership is realized through the transformation of society and the realization of human potential. Leadership is an action that brings you greater self-awareness. Your keen awareness helps others see their own life in a new light. You help others realize the empowerment that comes from creating the future with others."</p>
            <h4>Strengths and Weaknesses</h4>
            <ul class="swblock">
              <li>Charming
              <li>Sensitive to others
              <li>Imaginative
              <li>Passionate
              <li>Curious
              <li>Artistic
              <li>Fiercely Independent
              <li>Unpredictable
              <li>Easily Stressed
              <li>Overly Competitive
              <li>Fluctuating Self-Esteem
            </ul>
            <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h4>
            <p>As seen 16personalities.com says that adventurers tend to be fiercely independent individuals capable of imagining out of the box solutions and bringing them to life. This in addition with the other results shows an ability independently create and implement practical solutions whilst housing an awareness for the team members and environment and how that effects the work</p>
            <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h4>
            <p>While these results point to a potential for great problem solving and creativity, they also point to the success of a team being dependant on the interactions of the team with emphasis on encouraging and empowering each other, shared passions and a clear vision to reduce stress load.</p>
